# Potato Programming

Welcome to your programming journey! This repository is designed to track your progress and learning in programming through practical exercises and collaborative development practices.

## Workflow

### Pull Request Process
We follow a strict pull request workflow to help you become familiar with industry-standard collaborative programming practices. This approach will help you understand:
- Branch management
- Code review processes
- Version control best practices
- Collaborative development workflows

### Exercise Process
1. After each lesson, coding questions will be added to the main branch
2. You'll be notified when new questions are available
3. Create a new branch from the specific commit containing the question
4. Work on your solution in your branch
5. When ready, create a pull request to the main branch
6. Your code will be reviewed and approved if it meets the requirements
7. Feel free to add comments to your PR if you have questions about your implementation

## Getting Started

### Running JavaScript Files
Most initial tasks will require you to write JavaScript files. To run your scripts:
```bash
node ./script_name.js arg1 arg2...
```

Note: Future exercises may include test cases to verify your solutions.

## Learning Resources
While working on exercises:
- Try to solve problems independently first
- Feel free to search for solutions on Stack Overflow or other programming resources
- Ask for assistant through messages. Be concise about the problem you are facing
- If the question requirements are not clear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification
- Avoid using AI assistants to maintain the learning experience

Good luck with your programming journey! Happy coding! ðŸš€
